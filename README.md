# grbl-Mega-5X-Multibot
Port of grbl-Mega-5X to a MKS Gen L v2.1 board, configured for multibot

This is a modified version of https://github.com/fra589/grbl-Mega-5X pulled on 11/27/2021
I have extended it to work with a MKS GenL board and set it up to support limit switches,
buttons, a rotary axis, and auto squaring on the y axis.

I have only modified 3 files, and have included the origional files allong side them so you
can diff the files and see what has changed.

This is setup to work with the Multibot CNC project. You can find the 3D print files on
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4645791 and you can read up more on the project at
